# A Cloud Guru labs AWS CDK Stacks

## Description

This repo contains the following stacks:
1. lib/ec2-instance-stack.ts - provisions an Amazon EC2 instance in an existing VPC with a dynamically created key pair, a security group allowing SSH access from the deployerâ€™s public IP, and outputs connection instructions for SSH access.
2. lib/iam-user-customer-policy.ts -  creates a customer-managed IAM policy granting basic S3 permissions, attaches it to an IAM group, and provisions a new IAM user added to that group for controlled S3 access management.
3. lib/three-tier-network.ts - stack provisions a fully networked three-tier architecture with a custom VPC, public and private subnets, security groups, route tables, NAT and Internet gateways, and network ACLs for a SysOps environment.
4. lib/vpc-and-components-stack.ts - stack provisions a custom VPC with public and private subnets, internet gateway, route tables, and network ACLs configured for controlled inbound and outbound traffic.
